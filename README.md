# bad-icecream
A game based on the traditional "Bad Ice Cream" game trilogy.
In this game your objective is to collect all the cherries without being caught by the evil ice creams that follow a fixed path.
There are three levels to the game, however more can be coded in any time.
All menu screens, characters, and buttons were designed by me.
